# Accessing Oxygen XML Editor at UBC

To start, let’s address accessing Oxygen at UBC. The Digital Scholarship Lab contains 11 on-site workstations that come with Oxygen installed. There are also 6 remote-access computers (https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/digital-scholarship-workstations/) that you can access using your CWL. Just be mindful of the UBC Information Systems Appropriate Use Policy as always. Keep in mind that you are responsible for saving and backing up your work on a personal device or space, such as your UBC OneDrive account or a USB stick. The machines are wiped when you log off so don’t rely on the local storage on the computer for your work. The remote machines are available 24-hours a day while the lab machines are available as long as the library is open. We’ll include some best practices on saving and opening projects on a UBC as well later on.
