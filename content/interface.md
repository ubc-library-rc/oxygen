# Oxygen XML Editor UI

First, we'll be starting with an introduction to the Oxygen XML Editor's user interface. We'll work with an example .xml file as we go through this demo. Oxygen also comes prepackaged with a sample.xpr project, which contains example files and folders of many document types, such as DITA, Docbook, HTML, TEI, and so on. 

Oxygen XML Editor has a lot of features packed into it, and is intended for many different users and different goals, including some of the other document types and frameworks that we wonâ€™t get into. 

## Demo:

- Start screen: quick buttons to create new documents and projects, as well as tutorials and resources
- Create a new project (.xpr)
- Project View
- Create a new (.xml) file
- Selecting a schema (optional)
- Modes (e.g. text, grid, author)
- Perspectives (e.g. editor, XSLT debugger, XQuery debugger)
- Viewing files and tabs
- Resizing and moving panes
- Getting help (hit F1 in the window or tool)
- Outline View
- Model View
- Attributes View
- Elements View
- Entities View
- Transformation Scenarios View
- Toggling views (Window -> Show View)
- Toolbar
